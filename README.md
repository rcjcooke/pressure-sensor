# Pressure Sensor

Note: The sensor (Denso 079800-4250 5V PS-33) would not run directly off the Arduino Mega's 5V out (powered off USB at the time). Given the current draw appears to be only 6mA this should not have been a problem so I can only assume that the USB 5V output wasn't actually close enough to 5V to run the sensor's onboard electronics. I didn't bother measuring it this time but it's normally between 4.7 and 4.9 volts.
